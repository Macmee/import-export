# eximport

This module brings support for ECMAScript 6 import/export statements to your
projects.

This was forked from the unmaintained `import-export` package.

This exists because Node itself (as of 12.x LTS) does not enable ES6 module
support by default - see https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v12.x/api/esm.html - and
you can't insist that everybody runs node with `--experimental-modules` just to
load your module. If/when Node gets production ES6 module support this package
will become redundant and probably stop being maintained, because more
complicated scenarios absolutely require that you can rearrange the AST.

## Usage

In your top-level .js file require this module before your other project
includes. Node's module loader will be hooked to rewrite both `import` and
`export` statements into mutually compatible wrappers.

e.g. you might have an `index.js` like:

```
require("eximport")
module.exports = require("./src/foo")
```

...and a `src/foo.js` like:

```
import Bar from "./bar"
Bar.baz()
```

...and a `src/bar.js` like:

```
class Bar {
  static baz() {
    console.log("Hello World")
  }
}
export default Bar
```

## Return from require()

This returns an EximportBridgeNamespace object via `eximport-bridge`.

When you're using require() with an import/export module, you may either want to
expose the whole namespace (`require(...)`), just the default
(`require(...).default`) or a specific named export (`require(...).Foo`)

## How this works

At a simple level, `import {Foo} from "./foo"` is the same as
`var Foo = require("./foo").Foo`. Unfortunately it's not quite that simple
because "export" hoists (its names exist before the code delaring them is
executed), which is very valuable when you have circular references but needs to
be emulated here.

Instead, the code `import {Foo} from "./foo"` becomes roughly:

```
var Foo = require("./foo").Foo // Original line position
// Other code before the main script run starts...
Foo = require("./foo").Foo
```

This means that we can fill in the namespace entry early and then before
anything really uses it we can insert the final value. Specifically, we can do
that as soon as the exporting module body execution finishes.

The initial "var" line has to appear at its original (presumably top) level; by
doing so it inserts an entry directly into the correct namespace. It won't work
inside a function. Once the name exists, plain assignment in any scope which
inherits the original namespace is fine, so the second half is done via a
callback function. It doesn't make sense to do a second assingment once the
module's evaluation is complete, so at that point the callback handler is
dummied out and any pending callbacks executed.

On the exporting side, `export Foo` becomes roughly:

```
module.exports.Foo = null
// Other module code...
module.exports.Foo = Foo // Original line position
// Other module code...
```

This ensures that the names all exist before any other code's import returns,
and sets the correct value once it's known. It's necessary to do this in two
stages because only one type of value has both its declaration and value
hoisted: explicitly named functions.

## Notes/bugs & Known Limitations

### Self-modifying

This cannot modify the file it's required in.

###Â Complex Expressions

Due to the use of regexps, complex expressions won't be parseable. For example,
you might want to write:

```
export var foo=`export var bar=${baz.join(",") + `}`}`
```

That's simply not going to work unless the filter has a full understanding of
Javascript syntax and the ability to parse recursively, which isn't possible in
regular expressions. If you've got expressions like that, just split them into a
plain export (which eximport can handle) and the relevant assignment/expression
(which the Javascript engine can handle).

You might in some cases have a non-export/non-import expression which is picked
up as an export or import - if so, that's an unknown bug, and you should
consider reporting it if the code in question isn't pathological.
